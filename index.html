            deeply not just with me but also with all of my friends. Whenever the familiar tunes of Excuses or Brown

            sync. While AP Dhillon deserves immense credit for his talents, it's important to acknowledge the incredible
            contributions of his partners, Shinda Kahlon and Gurinder Gill, who are the true superstars behind the
            captivating beats of his music. Together, these three artists represent the bright future of the Punjabi
